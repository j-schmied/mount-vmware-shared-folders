# mount-vmware-shared-folders

Mounting shared folders to VMWare made easy!
This is a simple script to directly mount shared folders inside VMWare Linux VM's.

## Pre-Requisits

* Installed vmware-tools!

## Usage

`
chmod +x mount-vmware-shared-folders.sh
./mount-vmware-shared-folders.sh
`

## Tested on:

* Kali Linux 
* Debian
* Ubuntu
* So it should work for all Debian based distros for sure, I guess for others as well

Have fun!
