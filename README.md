# mount-vmware-shared-folders

Mounting shared folders to VMWare made easy!
This is a simple script to directly mount shared folders inside VMWare Linux VM's.

## Pre-Requisits

* Installed vmware-tools!

## Usage

```bash
chmod +x mount-vmware-shared-folders.sh
sudo ./mount-vmware-shared-folders.sh
```

## Tested on:
